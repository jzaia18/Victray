# Victray
A pokemon encyclopedia and forum
by Jake Zaia & Maximillion Korsun

## What is it?
Victray is a website that provides information about all kids of pokemon with a Reddit-like forum on top. This allows users to share their thoughts about pokemon, comment on the site, or share competitive strategies.

## How does it work?
Victray is a site run entirely using Python 2, HTML, and CSS. User and pokemon data is parsed and transmitted in python, and then renderred in HTML by a web browser.

## How can I run it?
Since Victray is run through python, one would need to set up a python webserver in order to view the pages. If you happen to have one already available, place this folder on the server and open the folder marked Victray, the server should handle the rest. Fortunately, Stuyvesant Highschool has dedicated servers for their active students, so as of now it can be viewed [here](http://homer.stuy.edu/~jake.zaia/IntroCS2/finalproject/612/)
